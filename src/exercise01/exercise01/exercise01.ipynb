    "### 2.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind Gymnasium is to provide an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) for all (single agent)reinforcement learning environments. It also provides a set of (rather simple) environments out of the box that are typically used for benchmarking new algorithms: cartpole, pendulum, mujoco (walker, humanoid, ...), atari, and more. The Gymnasium API is de facto becomgin the standard for projects that are used with control algorithms. Often, Gymnasium environments function as an interface (API) between a lower-level simulation and the user-implemented controller. This is, for instance, the case for MuJoCo environments, such as [Gymnasium Robotics](https://robotics.farama.org/index.html) where the simulation is done using [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/), or custom environments, such as our [Crazyflow environment](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crazyflow) where simulation is done using [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/quickstart.html) and [MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html), and many more. The Gymnasium Environments implement task-specific details, such as reward functions and termination conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Gymnasium is [`Env`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env), a high-level python class representing a [markov decision process (MDP)](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#optional-formalism) from reinforcement learning theory. The class provides users the ability to generate an initial state, transition to new states given an action, and visualize the environment. Alongside Env, [Wrappers](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/#gymnasium.Wrapper) are provided to help augment and modify the environment for particular tasks, for instance the agent observations, rewards and actions taken.\n",
    "\n",

    "After initializing the environment, we **must** call [`env.reset()`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.reset) to get the first observation of the environment along with optional additional information. For initializing the environment with a particular random seed or options you can pass those parameters to `reset()` - please refer to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the agent performs an action in the environment, [`env.step()`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.step) executes the selected action (in this case random with `env.action_space.sample()`) to update the environment. This action can be imagined as moving a robot or pressing a button on a games’ controller that causes a change within the environment. As a result, the agent receives a new observation from the updated environment along with a reward for taking the action. This reward could be for instance positive for destroying an enemy or a negative reward for moving into lava. One such action-observation exchange is referred to as a timestep.\n",

    "After some timesteps, the environment may end, this is called the **terminal state**. For instance, the robot may have crashed, or may have succeeded in completing a task, the environment will need to stop as the agent cannot continue. In Gymnasium, if the environment has **terminated**, this is returned by `step()` as the third variable. Similarly, we may also want the environment to end after a fixed number of timesteps, in this case, the environment issues a **truncated** signal. If either of terminated or truncated are True then we end the episode but **in most cases users might wish to restart the environment, this can be done with `env.reset()`**."

    "- [Observation space](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.observation_space): All valid observations are contained in that space. For control applications, we most commonly use [Box](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/spaces/fundamental/#gymnasium.spaces.Box).\n",

For control applications, again [Box](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/spaces/fundamental/#gymnasium.spaces.Box) is most commonly used, or [Discrete](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/spaces/fundamental/#gymnasium.spaces.Discrete).\n",
    "- **Truncate**: Most environments are set to have a time limit of a certain number of timesteps, which is usually implemented using the [TimeLimit wrapper](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/misc_wrappers/#gymnasium.wrappers.TimeLimit). The environment will truncate if the time limit is reached.\n",
    "- **Terminate**: Environments terminate after reaching a termination condition, such as a drone crashing or reaching its final goal.\n",
    "- If any of truncate or terminate occures, it is returned by the [step function](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.step) as shown above. In that case you usually reset the environment.\n",
    "- **Reset**: Environments are usually reset to a random state, which help to test the robustness of control algorithms. You can make the random state reproducibly by passing a [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) to a [reset function](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.reset). (Seeding is a common concepts for random number generators - it is useful to read up on this if you haven't done so.) Some environments, such as [crazyflow, also allow to set the initial state explicitely](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crazyflow/blob/d87bc1eaf100e7d8927731c630e52a7163108ecf/crazyflow/gymnasium_envs/crazyflow.py#L150), which is useful during development of control algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: if you come from a control background, you already know about the **state** of a system. A state must not be confused with **observations**. Typically, the observation is a subspace of the state that the policy receives as input to calculate the actions. An observation can also be an RGB image obtained from a camera. Its important to understand the [difference between states and observations](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#states-and-observations)."
